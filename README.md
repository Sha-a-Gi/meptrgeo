Why do things tend to fall apart for a mod?
1) Breaking changes from game or mod developers.
2) Long-running changes and scope complexity.

What are we going to do differently?
1) Implement a working continuous delivery model.
2) Focus on the fun.
3) Follow a single vision.

**FAQ**

* Q: Who are you?
* A: I am Tolkien fan with decades of experience in software and management.


* Q: Why pick up a dead mod?
* A: For this Tolkien fan CK2:MEP was too close to a masterpiece to let die as it was left by the previous team.


* Q: Will this mod be available via Steam Workshop?
* A: No. Any published versions on SW are unsupported and will be ignored.


* Q: Is there an official Discord server for this mod?
* A: No. The MEP Discord continues to operate but none of the previous modders/admins there are involved in this project.


* Q: Will the mod be versioned?
* A: No. Download or clone the latest copy from main to your CK2 mods folder.


* Q: How do I keep a copy from a specific commit on main branch?
* A: Make a local copy or create a fork and manage it yourself from upstream source.

* A: All approved merge requests will be merged to master immediately.

**Credits**

Many years ago when this mod started I briefly joined as a contributor.
I was just learning CK2 mods and sadly had to focus on other work.

Thanks to modders who gave thousands of hours bringing MEP to v0.8.3.

Thanks to all the other dedicated CK2 modders who continue to work on AGOT, Elder Kings, etc.

Thanks to Paradox Interactive for finally leaving CK2 alone and moving on to breaking mods in CK3.

Thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien for actually finishing his books unlike other authors.

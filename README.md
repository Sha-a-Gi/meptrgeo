**About CK2:MEP:TRGEO**

A reboot of the amazing Middle Earth Project mod for Crusader Kings 2 v3.3.3 from Paradox Interactive.

**Objectives**
1) Fix validation, bugs, lore, and fun ending issues.
2) Re-add key sandbox elements around artifacts.
3) Solve performance and balance problems for long-ish games.

**How Not to Fail**

Why do things tend to fall apart for a mod?
1) Breaking changes from game or mod developers.
2) Long-running changes and scope complexity.
3) Pointless hierarchies.

What are we going to do differently?
1) Implement a working continuous delivery model.
2) Focus on the fun.
3) Follow a single vision.

**FAQ**

* Q: Who are you?
* A: I am Tolkien fan with decades of experience in software and management.


* Q: Why pick up a dead mod?
* A: For this Tolkien fan CK2:MEP was too close to a masterpiece to let die as it was left by the previous team.


* Q: Will this mod be available via Steam Workshop?
* A: No. Any published versions on SW are unsupported and will be ignored.


* Q: Is there an official Discord server for this mod?
* A: No. The MEP Discord continues to operate but none of the previous modders/admins there are involved in this project.


* Q: Will the mod be versioned?
* A: No. Download or clone the latest copy from main to your CK2 mods folder.


* Q: How do I keep a copy from a specific commit on main branch?
* A: Make a local copy or create a fork and manage it yourself from upstream source.


* Q: Why did changes to main branch break my saved game?
* A: Backwards compatibility requires time/money and this is a free mod.


* Q: How frequently will this mod be updated?
* A: All approved merge requests will be merged to main ASAP.


* Q: My branch/merge request/code was deleted.
* A: All open branches/merge requests older than a week that haven't made it to master will be deleted.
Any code I find to be problematic at any point will be deleted.


* Q: Someone duplicated my work / beat me to an item on main branch / my feature was removed from TODO.
* A. Live with it, use it on your local copy, or create a project fork and manage it yourself.


* Q: I found a bug not on the TODO list, what should I do?
* A: Open an issue for the repository.


* Q: Will you be fixing missing non-English localization / timeline / CK2 version compatibility?
* A: Unless raised via clear issues on Github and accepted on to the TODO list in a (very large set no doubt!) of specific atomic changes - no.


* Q: How should I contact you?
* A: meptrgeo at protonmail dot com


* Q: Will you respond?
* A: Possibly.


* Q: Can I donate money / ask for things to be added to the TODO list / complain about something?
* A: No.

**Credits**

Many years ago when this mod started I briefly joined as a contributor.
I was just learning CK2 mods and sadly had to focus on other work.

Thanks to modders who gave thousands of hours bringing MEP to v0.831.

Thanks to all the other dedicated CK2 modders who continue to work on AGOT, Elder Kings, etc.

Thanks to Paradox Interactive for finally leaving CK2 alone and moving on to breaking mods in CK3.

Thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien for actually finishing his books unlike other authors.
